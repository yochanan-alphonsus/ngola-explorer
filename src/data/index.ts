The city is the capital of the province of Huambo and is located about 220 km E from Benguela and 600 km SE from Luanda. Huambo is a main hub on the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB) (the Benguela Railway), which runs from the port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of the Congo's southernmost province, Katanga. Huambo is served by the Albano Machado Airport (formerly Nova Lisboa Airport).",
    history: [
      "Huambo receives its name from Wambu, one of the 14 old Ovimbundu kingdoms of the central Angolan plateau. The Ovimbundu, an ethnic group that originally arrived from Eastern Africa, had founded their central kingdom of Bailundu as early as the 15th century. Wambu was one of the smaller kingdoms and was hierarchically under the king of Bailundu, though it enjoyed a considerable degree of independence.",
      "Whereas Bailundo is mentioned in some 18th and 19th-century chronicles in connection to a trading route linking it with Viye (Bie), Wambu was only really known with the advent of the construction of the Benguela Railway by the Portuguese. Though the kings of Bailundu and Wambu (particularly Ekuikui II and Katiavala I) opposed the penetration of the railway by ambushing workers and settlers, they were eventually subdued by the Portuguese Army and Huambo was officially founded on 8 August 1912 by the Governor-General of Angola Norton de Matos.",
      "The origin of Huambo and the economic importance it reached under Portuguese administration is very closely linked to the construction of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (Benguela Railway), which had started in the coastal town of Lobito in 1902. This railroad had been devised by the British entrepreneur Sir Robert Williams as the easiest and cheapest way to link the rich copper mines of Katanga, in Belgian Congo, with a point on the coast from which the mineral could be exported. The Lobito bay was admittedly the best natural seaport in the whole continent.",

      "Luanda was Portugal's bridgehead from 1627, except during the Dutch rule of Luanda, from 1640 to 1648, as Fort Aardenburgh. The city served as the centre of slave trade to Brazil from c. 1550 to 1836. The slave trade was conducted mostly with the Portuguese colony of Brazil; Brazilian ships were the most numerous in the port of Luanda. This slave trade also involved local merchants and warriors who profited from the trade. During this period, no large scale territorial conquest was intended by the Portuguese; only a few minor settlements were established in the immediate hinterland of Luanda, some on the last stretch of the Kwanza River.",

The Baixa de Luanda is situated next to the port, and has narrow streets and old colonial buildings. However, new constructions have by now covered large areas beyond these traditional limits, and a number of previously independent nuclei — like Viana — were incorporated into the city.",

      "Lunda Norte (English: North Lunda) is a province of Angola. It has an area of 103,760 km² and a population of 862,566. Angola's first President, Agostinho Neto, made Lucapa the provincial capital after independence, but the capital was later moved to Dundo. The province borders the Democratic Republic of Congo in the northeast and Lunda Sul in the south. The province is rich in gold and diamonds (Angola's second-largest revenue source after petroleum), but remains vastly underdeveloped and impoverished.",
    history: [
      "Lunda Norte, in northeastern Angola, was part of the powerful Lunda Empire (17th–19th century). The Lunda were known for a centralized political system led by a monarch (the Mwaant Yaav), complex trade networks, and connections with the Congo and Chokwe peoples. The region was rich in resources, especially ivory and later recognized for its diamonds.",
      "During the Scramble for Africa, Portugal took control of the area, integrating it into Portuguese Angola. The colonial administration exploited the region’s natural wealth, especially after the discovery of alluvial diamonds in the 1910s. In 1917, the Companhia de Diamantes de Angola (Diamang) was founded, and Lunda Norte became the center of Angola’s diamond industry. Forced labor, strict colonial controls, and displacement of local populations marked this period.",
      "After Angola’s independence in 1975, Lunda Norte became a contested region during the Angolan Civil War. Diamonds from the province funded the rebel group UNITA, leading to what became known as “conflict diamonds” or “blood diamonds.” This international issue brought attention to human rights abuses and illicit trade.",
      "Following the end of the war in 2002, the Angolan government reasserted control over Lunda Norte’s diamond fields. The province has since been a focus for reconstruction, but also criticism due to corruption, poor living conditions, and human rights violations linked to diamond extraction. Today, it remains one of the richest diamond-producing areas in the world, though local communities often see little benefit.",
